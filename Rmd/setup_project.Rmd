# Step 1: Load/install necessary packages for setting up .Rprofile file
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
if (!require("librarian")) {
    install.packages("librarian")
}

librarian::shelf(
#    bdchecks,  # prereq on ubuntu: `sudo apt install -y libjq-dev`
    broom, data.table, dplyr, forcats, fs, geosphere, 
    ggforce, ggplot2, glue, hablar, here, hms, httr, janitor, 
    jsonlite, knitr, lubridate, magrittr, 
    iobis/obistools,
    plotly, purrr, readr, readxl, renv, rmarkdown, stringr, tibble, 
    tidyr, tidyverse, tools, vroom, worrms)

# library("here")
# library("cli")
# 
# renv::dependencies()  %$% unique(Package) %>%
#     as_tibble() %>%
#     arrange(value) %>%
#     pull(value) %>%
#     cat(sep = ", ")
```

# Step 2: Run `rprofile_setup()`
Creates .Rprofile file that contains:
1. Designation of cloud storage path 
2. Loading of libraries needed for use in most processes
3. Attaches functions and scripts to search_path

NOTE: to take effect, will need to restart R afterwards
```{r}
source(here("scripts", "rprofile_setup.R"))
prof <- here(".Rprofile")

# .choose 
#   TRUE: gives popup to select directory
#   FALSE: open .Rprofile for manual addition to line 1
rprofile_setup(prof = prof, 
               .choose = TRUE)

rm(list = ls())
```

# Step 3: Use .Rprofile to setup directories, source scripts with functions needed and attach to search path

1. Creates directory for consistent file structure

2. Copy files from designated location
    - The first time using, this will open a `.Rprofile` file and add `cloud_dir` if not already added. This is where the raw data would be stored. If you want to select through a popup set `copy_files_cloud(.choose = TRUE)` and will paste to .Rprofile. You can manually paste into .Rprofile if `.choose = FALSE`. You will then need to restart R.
    - If you want to auto-look for new files, edit `copy_files_cloud(ask = TRUE)` to `copy_files_cloud(ask = TRUE, auto = TRUE)`.
    Each `Restart` in R will look for new files and ask if you want to download. 

3. Load functions for searching the raw for taxa names and connecting it to a master sheet
- if a master sheet doesn't exists locally, it will start a new one and put it in:
    - `data/metadata/aphia_id`

# Run Rmd file in order
1. `taxa_match_up_WoRMS.Rmd`
    - match raw data to taxa
2. `combine_zoo_logsheets.Rmd`
    - get metadata and merge all files together
3. `create_obis_event.Rmd`
    - combine raw data and metadata to create obis formatted data
